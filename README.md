# Dragging You to the Depths of (Bullet) Hell
 A little bullet hell game made using the [LOVE](https://github.com/love2d/love) framework

To start the game, drag folder `src` onto shortcut `love`.

Quick note - LOVE is compatible with Linux (or Ubuntu at the very least)  
If you'd like to play, retrieve love (it is available in Ubuntu's package manager) and run love with directory `src` as the argument or open the folder directly using love.

## Controls
- Movement: WASD
- Precise movement: left shift (Also makes hitbox smaller)
- Fire: spacebar or LMB
